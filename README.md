# Off-axis projection in Unity

A bare-minimum example project for getting off-axis projection up and running in Unity.

This work is based on the article found [here](https://medium.com/@michel.brisis/off-axis-projection-in-unity-1572d826541e?source=friends_link&sk=1884d03651947a41cd553168714cbfb6).

The application can be executed as follows:

- Run 'off-axis-projection.exe' found in the Built-Application folder.
- From console, access the Python-tracking directory >> cd C:\<path>\off-axis-projection-unity-master\Python-tracking
- Run >>python main.py

The application should begin showing the off-axis perspective as shown in this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11oc2YuKHkMvqdLqCBxBuSGJyH_6QfDcP/view?usp=sharing).

To run object detection part, run object_detection_darkflow.py file from Python-tracking folder. Darkflow framework should be installed previously, as explained in the following link: https://towardsdatascience.com/yolov2-object-detection-using-darkflow-83db6aa5cf5f. Video showing the demo of the application is present in the following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zB8pSATkNv59yAFRSDUCvrFnwwERF9Cx.

For exiting the applications just press Esc.
